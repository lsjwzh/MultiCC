## v1.6.1 — Task-bound sessions, scheduled messages, and signed APK releases

### Highlights

- **Task board with bound chat sessions** — every task now owns a dedicated 1:1 hidden chat session. Open a task to see its live transcript, send follow-ups, cancel runs, and clean up worktrees. Tasks carry stable short codes (`#CODE`) and archived tasks release their bound sessions.
- **Scheduled messages** — queue messages into a session FIFO and review them in a floating dock before they are sent.
- **Signed APK distribution** — Android APKs are built on demand and attached to GitHub Releases, signed with the project release key. The `/manage` APK area prefers a local `public/multicc.apk` and falls back to the exact release asset for the server's package version.
- **Relay sharing for remote access** — generate relay tokens and pick addresses from `/manage`; share provider configurations securely via the `MULTICC_PROXY_TOKEN` CPR proxy.
- **Hibernate idle task worktrees** — idle task-bound chat worktrees are automatically hibernated to free system resources.
- **Voice task announcements** — voice mode announces the identity of completed tasks so you can stay hands-free.
- **Dynamic Claude model list** — the Claude model picker is populated from your local Claude CLI bundle and cached for one day.

### Improvements and fixes

- Task-run failures are now visible with bounded automatic retry and clearer wrapper exit / compile-input streams.
- Tool cards show running-state animations; native prompt/confirm/alert dialogs are replaced with in-page dialogs.
- Streaming markdown renders are coalesced on a 50 ms timer for a smoother chat experience.
- Cancel escalation now moves from SIGTERM to SIGKILL after a grace period.
- Codex Agent Wait cards display the wait scope instead of empty agent IDs.
- Claude/Codex login banners are shown only for official providers.
- Server route mounting was refactored into a chained `mountRoutes` pipeline while keeping `server.js` within its 3 000-line migration budget.
